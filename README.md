[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mr-calvert/flightready.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mr-calvert/flightready)

NOTE: Development is TEMPORARILY paused while I ramp up at a new job with Spunk.

Finally tagless/Free integrations; stdio for FP Scala!

A real introduction is pending.

Until then...
Flightready intends to be a home for algebras and interpreters supporting finally tagless and Free IO programs of all sorts.

Phase I involves establishing good baseline patterns and infrastructure and a collection of algebras and interpreters comprising a pure FP wrapper for the JVM's NIO and NIO2.

Later phases will add higher level abstractions for writing logic against KV stores and less specific filesystem like data models which be be interpreted into JVM NIO, AWS S3, Google Cloud Files, etc. Algebras and interpreters for other cloud services data bases, etc. Anything goes really. With luck we'll have a large and powerful ecosystem.
